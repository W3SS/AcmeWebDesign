An HTML5 website for a fictional web design company. It uses semantic elements to provide a responsive mobile friendly experience. Built to teach me how to create websites with a clean UI/UX layout.

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <!div> and <!span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <!form>, <!table>, and <!article> - Clearly defines its content.
